                                            My name is Nathan Bresser my student ID is s3819728 and I’m a member of
                                            group AGIT. I am a 24 year-old Canberra native currently living in Sydney
                                            and working for a big four consulting firm and my hobbies are cycling and
                                            watching films. My grandparents emigrated from the Netherlands in the 60s
                                            and I am an English speaker. I’ve had an interest in IT from a very young
                                            age when my farther taught me how to use the family PC. Since then I lost
                                            touch with IT and pursued a career in accounting but have found that as time
                                            goes on, I continue to seek out opportunities at work that allow me to learn
                                            and develop my IT skills. My curiosity with IT was sparked again when I
                                            realised I could automate some of my work with VBA in Excel and currently my
                                            interest is focused on developing a ASP.NET web application. Through this
                                            project at work I've been able to explore HTML with Bootstrap, C# and SQL.
                                            This has exposed to me that If I want to pursue IT properly as a career, I
                                            need a formal education in the fundamentals, so I have decided to enrol in
                                            the Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My goal is to move from my Finance focused
                                            career path to a role where I can leverage my finance experience, business
                                            acumen and my IT skills.

                                            My name is Tee Ming Chew and I am a member of AGIT. My student number is
                                            s3812497. I am a
                                            Malaysian Chinese born and raised on a tropical island known as Penang. This
                                            island is
                                            famous for its delicious delicacies and heritage sites. I am currently a
                                            student
                                            at RMIT
                                            preparing to enrol in the Bachelor of Information Technology degree program.
                                            I
                                            help to
                                            manage and set up the audio visual system for my local church on a regular
                                            basis
                                            and for
                                            special events. I started out without prior experience or knowledge but
                                            gained
                                            many new
                                            skills and broadened my range of understanding. I regularly assist by
                                            maintaining the audio
                                            and visual equipment such as projectors, microphones, mixers, cables,
                                            amongst
                                            other
                                            hardware. My interest in Information Technology (IT) stems from the amazing
                                            innovation
                                            behind the development of technology by large companies and small projects
                                            created by a
                                            single person. From my perspective, technology is not limited by the
                                            capabilities of
                                            hardware, but rather by the creativity of the idea. Although I have had no
                                            professional
                                            experience in the world of IT, I have always immersed myself in discovering
                                            ways
                                            of making
                                            my entertainment more convenient or accessible.

                                            Hi, I’m Kris and I am from the SE suburbs of Melbourne VIC with English as
                                            my
                                            only spoken
                                            language. Student number S3819605 and our team name is AGIT. In 2000 I
                                            finished
                                            my VCE along
                                            with a few TAFE certifications in IT, since then I have studied off and on
                                            with
                                            some vendor
                                            specific certs such as CompTIA Network+ which I achieved in 2012 and have
                                            also
                                            trained
                                            online with CBTNuggets for the cisco CCNA, Microsoft server and exchange
                                            server
                                            but did not
                                            complete the certification track due to workload.. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT since
                                            around the age of 8 which was sparked by my first computer, the commodore
                                            amiga
                                            64. Since
                                            then I had grown up with having computers and laptops which at the time in
                                            the
                                            80’s and 90’s
                                            was not such a common thing unlike today. At the age of 12 I started to work
                                            on
                                            computer
                                            hardware which lead to starting my first business at 16 as a pc builder.
                                            Once I
                                            finished
                                            school I moved away from the IT world to work in the trades to which I
                                            eventually started
                                            working for a physical security company (CCTV, alarm, access control) which
                                            was
                                            heavily IP
                                            based and re sparked my interest in working with IT.

                                            My name is Kristian Muller my student ID is s3728068 and I'm group member of
                                            AGIT. I
                                            currently reside in the beach suburb of Henley Beach South Australia. I'm
                                            currently studying
                                            a bachelor of logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. My hobbies
                                            include
                                            playing
                                            footy and golf on the weekend as well as watching a good movie. My interest
                                            in
                                            IT is
                                            functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the
                                            supply
                                            chain
                                            increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT, but
                                            recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that
                                            contributes to supply
                                            chain management effectiveness for firms like WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new
                                            interest has come
                                            about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using
                                            paper-based
                                            inventory
                                            control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart
                                            from
                                            using the
                                            basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to
                                            control inventory.
                                            However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

                                            I was born in Sydney, Australia and currently live in Balmain East and I’m
                                            part of the group AGIT. My parents are multigenerational Australians with
                                            English, Irish and Italian ancestry. I completed my high school education in
                                            2009, since then I have completed a Diploma of Financial Planning and am
                                            working towards a Bachelor of Business. I speak English but would love to
                                            learn another language at some point in the future (maybe a programming
                                            language). My interests include exercise, sports, philosophy, meditation and
                                            travel. My interest in IT is based on my current lack of technological
                                            knowledge. I want to be able to participate effectively and make use of
                                            advancing technologies. I am a Wealth Consultant at Westpac and use role
                                            specific programs, I can use basic programs like Word, Power Point etc. and
                                            use a number of social media platforms. I chose to study at RMIT as I want
                                            to pursue a career in finance, in particular financial analysis. Having a
                                            strong understanding of Information Technology will be very useful, as using
                                            data and presenting data will be a key function in finance.

                                            permanent
                                            residency. Originally, I am from Germany so logically my first language is
                                            German. I grew up
                                            in Hamburg, a city with a
                                            population of just over 2 mio. people. My lifestyle in Australia has changed
                                            drastically, as
                                            I live and work in a rural area on a cattle farm. I enjoy both, technology
                                            and
                                            nature and I
                                            would like to bring both of
                                            these areas together and utilise IT to improve farming practices, reduce
                                            excessive use and
                                            wastage of natural
                                            resources and consequently reduce the cost of operation in farming. My

                                            used thefirst video game consoles and desktop computers and eventually, with
                                            the
                                            vast
                                            development of
                                            IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet,
                                            Cloud
                                            Computing, automatization, IoT & MachineLearning),
                                            I realized that IT can be used for so much more. It can be used not only for
                                            big
                                            companies
                                            to do, for
                                            instance, complex calculations, but it can now actually be used to make
                                            everyone’s
                                            day-to-day tasks easier. As soon as I had realized that, I started to get
                                            more
                                            interested in
                                            programming and
                                            IoT. I also started to learn a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as
                                            well as
                                            Python and
                                            developed my own little projects with the Raspberry Pi. My studies at the
                                            RMIT
                                            will
                                            hopefully guide me the way to become a professional in IT and will help me
                                            to
                                            develop
                                            solutions for a more sustainable world, supported by IT.

                                            I also completed an only psychometric text for abstract reasoning. This
                                            required me to find the missing item in sequences and matrixes of shapes and
                                            symbols. This was the first time I have attempted a test like this and I was
                                            only able to get to 4 of the 15 questions in the seven minutes and thirty
                                            seconds of time provided. I was able to answer 3 of the questions correctly.

                                    indicator test results first and the splits between each indicator by team member.
                                    The group can be seen to trend towards Intuition and Feeling, while being divided
                                    relatively equally between Extraversion/Introversion and Judging/Perceiving.

                                    Being aware of each members different personality types can be useful to the team as
                                    it shows that we are a varied group and that we should be ready for each team member
                                    to go about their work in different ways and to understand that not everyone will be
                                    able to conform to another team members view of how to complete the project.

                                    The MBIT provides the strengths of each personality type it also provides the
                                    weaknesses of each type. We can see though that each team member’s weakness is
                                    counteracted by another team member’s strength. So, while one team member might,
                                    “find it difficult to focus”, other team members are both “tolerant” and “Loyal,
                                    Patient and Reliable”. In the same vein another team member is “Inflexible and

                                    The accuracy of the MBIT can certainly be questioned but the test serves its purpose
                                    to show that while each team member is different it’s important for each of us to
                                    appreciate that fact and not become frustrated or dejected when our differences
                                    clash.

                                    The Group also completed Learning Style Tests, the results of these test extend the
                                    learnings from the MBIT tests. We had 3 tactile learners, 1 visual learner and 2
                                    auditory learners. These results further highlight the need to appreciate each
                                    other’s differences but also to understand our own learning style which should help
                                    each team member approach the project tasks in a ways that optimise their
                                    contribution.

                                    Each group member selected a third test of their own choosing 3 team members
                                    completed a Big Five Personality Test the other three team members completed a
                                    psychometric test, a team roles Test and a political compass. The varied choice of
                                    test again highlights the diversity of the group. The results of these tests
                                    themselves are less useful than the other tests as not all members completed the
                                    same test.

                                    The Team's ideal jobs are as varied as the team members themselves. 5 of the roles
                                    are IT specific with only one being finance related. There is however a great deal
                                    of alignment when looking at the general skills required for all the jobs. All the
                                    roles require Communication Skills and 5 of the 6 require Problem Solving. In
                                    general, of the skills that are required, there was very few that were not included
                                    in at least two thirds of the jobs.

                                    The IT skills were more differentiated. Some jobs like Front end Developer and Full
                                    Stack Developer required in depth knowledge on specific programming languages and
                                    are more technical in nature. One Job was Chief Technology Officer which as the most
                                    senior of the jobs requires in depth knowledge as well and management and business
                                    skills. Two of the roles, Information Technology Support and DevOps/Agile Consultant
                                    tie together business process and Its knowledge.

                                    The career paths of the group are generally quite different. Some of the group, like
                                    Tee and Angelo are looking to start their careers in IT and specifically in
                                    development work they have a strong passion for the technical side of IT. Ben
                                    currently works in financial advice and while he is not looking to move into working
                                    in IT he see the value of understanding IT as he moves up in his career in the
                                    finance industry. Similarly, Kristian M is looking to combine logistics and supply

                                    upskilling in IT. The end goals of each team member do vary widely but it's clear
                                    that was is similar is that each member is building on their current experience and
                                    passions to plan a career that can utilise their current skills and their passion
                                    for IT.
