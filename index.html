                                            My name is Nathan Bresser my student ID is s3819728 and I’m a member of
                                            group AGIT. I am a 24 year-old Canberra native currently living in Sydney
                                            and working for a big four consulting firm and my hobbies are cycling and
                                            watching films. My grandparents emigrated from the Netherlands in the 60s
                                            and I am an English speaker. I’ve had an interest in IT from a very young
                                            age when my farther taught me how to use the family PC. Since then I lost
                                            touch with IT and pursued a career in accounting but have found that as time
                                            goes on, I continue to seek out opportunities at work that allow me to learn
                                            and develop my IT skills. My curiosity with IT was sparked again when I
                                            realised I could automate some of my work with VBA in Excel and currently my
                                            interest is focused on developing a ASP.NET web application. Through this
                                            project at work I've been able to explore HTML with Bootstrap, C# and SQL.
                                            This has exposed to me that If I want to pursue IT properly as a career, I
                                            need a formal education in the fundamentals, so I have decided to enrol in
                                            the Bachelor of IT at RMIT. My goal is to move from my Finance focused
                                            career path to a role where I can leverage my finance experience, business
                                            acumen and my IT skills.

                                            My name is Tee Ming Chew and I am a member of AGIT. My student number is
                                            s3812497. I am a
                                            Malaysian Chinese born and raised on a tropical island known as Penang. This
                                            island is
                                            famous for its delicious delicacies and heritage sites. I am currently a
                                            student
                                            at RMIT
                                            preparing to enrol in the Bachelor of Information Technology degree program.
                                            I
                                            help to
                                            manage and set up the audio visual system for my local church on a regular
                                            basis
                                            and for
                                            special events. I started out without prior experience or knowledge but
                                            gained
                                            many new
                                            skills and broadened my range of understanding. I regularly assist by
                                            maintaining the audio
                                            and visual equipment such as projectors, microphones, mixers, cables,
                                            amongst
                                            other
                                            hardware. My interest in Information Technology (IT) stems from the amazing
                                            innovation
                                            behind the development of technology by large companies and small projects
                                            created by a
                                            single person. From my perspective, technology is not limited by the
                                            capabilities of
                                            hardware, but rather by the creativity of the idea. Although I have had no
                                            professional
                                            experience in the world of IT, I have always immersed myself in discovering
                                            ways
                                            of making
                                            my entertainment more convenient or accessible.

                                            Hi, I’m Kris and I am from the SE suburbs of Melbourne VIC with English as
                                            my
                                            only spoken
                                            language. Student number S3819605 and our team name is AGIT. In 2000 I
                                            finished
                                            my VCE along
                                            with a few TAFE certifications in IT, since then I have studied off and on
                                            with
                                            some vendor
                                            specific certs such as CompTIA Network+ which I achieved in 2012 and have
                                            also
                                            trained
                                            online with CBTNuggets for the cisco CCNA, Microsoft server and exchange
                                            server
                                            but did not
                                            complete the certification track due to workload.. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT since
                                            around the age of 8 which was sparked by my first computer, the commodore
                                            amiga
                                            64. Since
                                            then I had grown up with having computers and laptops which at the time in
                                            the
                                            80’s and 90’s
                                            was not such a common thing unlike today. At the age of 12 I started to work
                                            on
                                            computer
                                            hardware which lead to starting my first business at 16 as a pc builder.
                                            Once I
                                            finished
                                            school I moved away from the IT world to work in the trades to which I
                                            eventually started
                                            working for a physical security company (CCTV, alarm, access control) which
                                            was
                                            heavily IP
                                            based and re sparked my interest in working with IT.

                                            My name is Kristian Muller my student ID is s3728068 and I'm group member of
                                            AGIT. I
                                            currently reside in the beach suburb of Henley Beach South Australia. I'm
                                            currently studying
                                            a bachelor of logistics and supply chain management at RMIT. My hobbies
                                            include
                                            playing
                                            footy and golf on the weekend as well as watching a good movie. My interest
                                            in
                                            IT is
                                            functional; it is in a variety of software and hardware that can make the
                                            supply
                                            chain
                                            increasingly efficient for businesses to manage. I have always had an
                                            interest
                                            in IT, but
                                            recently this has developed into a specific interest in software that
                                            contributes to supply
                                            chain management effectiveness for firms like WIMS, WMS or JAIX. This new
                                            interest has come
                                            about since the warehouse I work in part time has moved from using
                                            paper-based
                                            inventory
                                            control to paperless RF scanners. I haven’t had much experience in IT apart
                                            from
                                            using the
                                            basics in the Microsoft suite and beginning to use RF scanners at work to
                                            control inventory.
                                            However, I am interested in broadening my knowledge in the area.

                                            I was born in Sydney, Australia and currently live in Balmain East and I’m
                                            part of the group AGIT. My parents are multigenerational Australians with
                                            English, Irish and Italian ancestry. I completed my high school education in
                                            2009, since then I have completed a Diploma of Financial Planning and am
                                            working towards a Bachelor of Business. I speak English but would love to
                                            learn another language at some point in the future (maybe a programming
                                            language). My interests include exercise, sports, philosophy, meditation and
                                            travel. My interest in IT is based on my current lack of technological
                                            knowledge. I want to be able to participate effectively and make use of
                                            advancing technologies. I am a Wealth Consultant at Westpac and use role
                                            specific programs, I can use basic programs like Word, Power Point etc. and
                                            use a number of social media platforms. I chose to study at RMIT as I want
                                            to pursue a career in finance, in particular financial analysis. Having a
                                            strong understanding of Information Technology will be very useful, as using
                                            data and presenting data will be a key function in finance.

                                            residency. Originally, I am from Germany so logically my first language is

                                            population of just over 2 mio. people. My lifestyle in Australia has changed
                                            drastically, as
                                            I live and work in a rural area on a cattle farm. I enjoy both, technology

                                            nature and I
                                            would like to bring both of
                                            these areas together and utilise IT to improve farming practices, reduce
                                            excessive use and
                                            wastage of natural
                                            resources and consequently reduce the cost of operation in farming. My
                                            interests
                                            in IT
                                            started when I was young. I
                                            used thefirst video game consoles and desktop computers and eventually, with
                                            the
                                            vast
                                            development of
                                            IT within the last 15 years (introduction of the iPhone, HighSpeed Internet,
                                            Cloud
                                            Computing, automatization, IoT & MachineLearning),
                                            I realized that IT can be used for so much more. It can be used not only for
                                            big
                                            companies
                                            to do, for
                                            instance, complex calculations, but it can now actually be used to make
                                            everyone’s
                                            day-to-day tasks easier. As soon as I had realized that, I started to get
                                            more
                                            interested in
                                            programming and
                                            IoT. I also started to learn a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as
                                            well as
                                            Python and
                                            developed my own little projects with the Raspberry Pi. My studies at the
                                            RMIT
                                            will
                                            hopefully guide me the way to become a professional in IT and will help me
                                            to
                                            develop
                                            solutions for a more sustainable world, supported by IT.

                              <p>
                                The group has had a beneficial experience of working together and communicating with one other in Assignment 2. Despite a slow start, the communication between group members increased and improved quickly after each group meeting held. Furthermore, the workflow of the group steadily increased towards the deadline of the assignment. The progress of each member's work was communicated through a group conversation on WhatsApp, a simple means of text messaging, while the main discussions concerning the tasks were discussed and completed over voice conferences in Microsoft Teams. These communication tools combined with the mind map that held an overview of the delegated work tasks that needed to be completed, formed a strong foundation that the group could rely on over the time spent working together to complete the assignment. However, there are still many areas that can be improved on to further increase the group's productivity.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                From beginning work on Assignment 3, the group has seen a radical shift in processes of group work. Firstly, the group has increased the number of group meetings held every week from once a week to twice a week. This allows the group to discuss important details together before starting on individual tasks. Additionally, the group has introduced more flexible meeting times. As a result of our increased communication, the group brings forward or postpones meetings to best suit the availability of every member. In the case of group members still being unable to participate, the group meetings for Assignment 3 are now recorded for those who are absent so that they can be kept up to date.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Moreover, as the group continues to gain familiarity with Microsoft Teams, the group has begun using more of its functionalities more efficiently. For example, the group now organises the files stored in Microsoft Team's cloud storage system. This is because of the large number of files required as a part of the group's various ongoing projects. The group has also started using a task plan with multiple columns and checkboxes that delegate the group work instead of relying on the mind map as previously when the group worked on Assignment 2. This gives the group a more structured and organised outlook on the work to be completed and by whom. It also provides a clear and detailed manner of viewing internal deadlines and allows group members to comment on each task and post relevant details and opinions.

                                Comparison of Career Plans Between Each Group Member
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                              Across the group, the majority of members are interested in pursuing a career in the world of IT. This is mostly done by first gaining the relevant skills through an undergraduate degree or diploma. Some of the group members, such as Kristen and Tee Ming, have goals to obtain a position of leadership in their respective occupations after gaining the necessary experience. Other members, such as Kristen, Benjamin, and Nathan, do not have similar goals at the moment. In contrast, Angelo is the only group member with plans to be self-employed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Upon closer inspection, many members of the group have career plans in completely different areas. For example, Benjamin is the only member of the group who is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Financial Planning instead of in IT. Ideally, he plans to work as an investment analyst within an investment fund. In comparison, the rest of the group have career plans in varying areas of IT. Tee Ming is pursuing to be a Front-End developer, working with the latest web development technology. Similarly, Angelo is aiming to become a Full Stack developer skilled in both front and back end of applications or websites. Kristian intends to work as an IT Support Officer and provide support in managing, maintaining and improving IT services and infrastructures while Kristen also has similar plans but to be in the management role of such an area. Finally, Nathan is looking to become an Agile/DevOps consultant at DigitalBCG. This occupation would seemingly be most related to Benjamin's interest in business and the rest of the group's interest in the world of IT.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Overall, every member has plans to study and work simultaneously to gain the necessary skills, experience and qualifications to realise their career plan. Only Kristen already has some experience and knowledge in IT gained from his current occupation. However, he currently works in the physical security sector and wishes to move into cybersecurity. Between each group member's ideal job, there are a few common factors, but they are all quite different from one another in terms of the specific area of expertise required. In contrast, every group member's career plan is quite close with regards to placing an importance on gaining working experience in their respective field as well as an academic accreditation.
