                    <li>
                        <strong>WhatsApp</strong><br />
                        Used by the group to communicate each member’s progress on their work and to notify the group of their status and upcoming meetings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Microsoft Team</strong><br />
                        Used to hold voice conferences to discuss important details of the assignment. The additional features in the program such as Task Plan is used to provide an overview of the workload and to delegate tasks to each person. The Files feature stores all our important documents in Microsoft’s cloud system. Microsoft Teams allows us to work on these documents simultaneously and automatically saves work done.

                    <li>
                        <strong>GitHub</strong><br />
                        Used as a version control for the group website. Allows different members from different places to make contributions in forming the website. It is also used to host the website.

                        <strong>Bootstrap</strong><br />

                    The audit trail on the Git repository does not reflect our group’s work together. A large part of the work for this assignment is done using Microsoft Word and the workload is delegated in Microsoft Teams. The group divides the assignment workload among each group member while only a few people work on the group website. The task delegation is accomplished using the Task Plan feature as shown in the screenshot below. The group sets internal deadlines and checklists to keep track of the work done by each person. Additionally, group members can see who has last accessed each document and make comments on each other’s work to provide feedback as the group works together.

                    The group was able to communicate effectively by using Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp. Group meetings were productive in discussing the details of the project and updating each other on our progress. Essential files were all stored in Microsoft Team's cloud storage which made it easy for all group members to edit and view them. The Task Plan feature of Microsoft Teams assisted the group in managing all the work that needed to be done and by whom. Group members were able to comment on tasks to provide information at their convenience. This was a huge improvement over the last assessment task where the group used a mind map to cover this. Group communication efforts still have room for improvement. Only a partial few members communicate regularly and effectively in the WhatsApp group chat. It is important that group members update the rest of the group on their status and work progress even though there is nothing new to show. One that was surprising was how quickly the group had grown to work with each other. Group meetings were conducted effectively and to the point because of how well group members understood each other’s strength and weaknesses. Stronger trust had developed between group members to complete their work on time. I have learned that groups take time for group members to adjust to one another and once the adjustment period is over, productivity will increase and group processes are carried out more efficiently. I have also learned the importance of including every group member to create a collaborative environment where each member feels the need to contribute.
