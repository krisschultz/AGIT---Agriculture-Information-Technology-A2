                    <li>
                        <strong>WhatsApp</strong><br />
                        Has been used for general group communication outside of official scheduled meetings and group
                        work sessions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Microsoft Team</strong><br />
                        Collaboration tool that has been a keystone in the success of our team’s workflow and
                        contribution efforts.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>GitHub</strong><br />
                        Team repository and website hosted within the GitHub platform.

                        <strong>Bootstrap</strong><br />
                        As a CSS & JavaScript Library for the team website.

                        <strong>Canvas</strong><br />
                        Initially used to form our group. Also used very early in the assignment to discuss how we would
                        proceed as a team and which platforms to utilize.

                    The audit trail in GitHub is not in any way an accurate reflection of the group's efforts and
                    contributions as the majority of the work has been done within Microsoft Teams.

                <p>
                    Within Teams we have used Microsoft Word to write up the assignment report and all team members have
                    contributed. Additionally, we have used a mind map within Teams to layout and delegate the overall
                    workload of the assignment. Refer to the below screenshot as evidence.

                    The group was able to communicate effectively by using Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp. Group meetings were productive in discussing the details of the project and updating each other on our progress. Essential files were all stored in Microsoft Team's cloud storage which made it easy for all group members to edit and view them. The Task Plan feature of Microsoft Teams assisted the group in managing all the work that needed to be done and by whom. Group members were able to comment on tasks to provide information at their convenience. This was a huge improvement over the last assessment task where the group used a mind map to cover this. Group communication efforts still have room for improvement. Only a partial few members communicate regularly and effectively in the WhatsApp group chat. It is important that group members update the rest of the group on their status and work progress even though there is nothing new to show. One that was surprising was how quickly the group had grown to work with each other. Group meetings were conducted effectively and to the point because of how well group members understood each other’s strength and weaknesses. Stronger trust had developed between group members to complete their work on time. I have learned that groups take time for group members to adjust to one another and once the adjustment period is over, productivity will increase and group processes are carried out more efficiently. I have also learned the importance of including every group member to create a collaborative environment where each member feels the need to contribute.
