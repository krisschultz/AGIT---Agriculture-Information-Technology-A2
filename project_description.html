                          At AGIT we will use modern information technology to help farmers to improve production, efficiency and profits while reducing the strain on the environment. Our bigger picture is to develop and produce a network of sensors, actuators and user interfaces, connected to a cloud-based software (“the brain”), to address all the issues given above. Having said that, our focus for this project will lie on a feed demand calculator for cattle, accessible via web browsers, smartphones and user interface displays.

                          Why?

                      <p>
                          Australia is one of the largest beef exporters in the world (GLOBAL SNAPSHOT l BEEF, 2019) and large parts of Australia are in a drought. Not all livestock can be saved. To revive an operation after a catastrophic weather event like the current drought, a core of the stock needs to be saved and fed through the event. Our feed calculator will help with that.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          The project is important because of the size of the cattle industry in Australia, the benefits that it could provide to farmers who often face tough conditions and the environmental benefits that could be gained. It helps farmers by assisting with calculations that determine the efficient and economical delivery of food to animals, when they need it - ultimately preventing under/over feeding.

                          Working on this project would display to employers an ability to research and plan, as well as collaborate with team members to deliver a unique concept that has not been developed elsewhere. It would show an understanding of the software and hardware tools required to bring the concept to life.

                          There are a variety of ‘mixers’ being used by farmers to evenly distribute ingredients in a batch of feed before they are prepared for cattle to eat. There are vertical mixers and horizontal mixers <strong>< additional info to be added ></strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          The point of difference for AGIT’s product compared to a regular mixer is that the composition of ingredients is being recommended rather than added at the farmers discretion.

                                    AGIT has two primary aims. The first is to 'help farmers farm more efficiently’ and the second is to ‘reduce administration for farmers’. The app will assist farmers to allocate feed in a way that is economical and most beneficial to the animal and will remove the need for manually recording the data. Currently there is no technology-based solution that can be employed by farmers to more accurately determine the necessary ingredients and total amounts of feed required by the animals they maintain. This app will save time and money for the farmer, whilst improving the health of his or her animals.

                                AGIT have decided to give each team member within the group a specific role as each member has interests and expertise in different areas. We feel that giving roles to each person will increase ownership of tasks in the project as well as giving members the ability to focus on their strengths.
                                </br></br> The roles are as follows:
                            </p>

                                Project Manager - Kristen Schultz

                            <p>
                                Kristen has been given the role as project manager because before moving to AGIT he was a project manager for a large-scale security company. We believe that Kristen’s experience in managing projects will be invaluable to making sure everyone within the group is meeting internal deadlines. Therefore, we believe Kristen will be an integral part of the project being completed on time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Angelo has been given the role of lead developer due to being the brainchild of the feed calculator. After moving to Australia from Germany Angelo has been working on a cattle farm and has found that farmers could be saving money by feeding animals more efficiently. He believes that his idea of a feed calculator app using industry data to measure animals’ dietary needs and dispensing the right amount of feed, could be the answer to saving farmers lost capital outlay in overfeeding.

                                Tee Ming has been given the position of software engineer due to his problem-solving skills as shown by volunteering at his local church fixing audio systems. He has shown a keen interest in software writing and has been quick in acquiring this new skill. He has developed a good understanding of software language used in both JavaScript and Python and is the perfect person to take the role of software engineer within AGIT.

                                Kristian has a keen interest in IT and is very passionate about customer satisfaction once the product has left AGIT and is being used in the field by farmers. He has excellent communication skills along with troubleshooting experience consequently he has been given the role of post sales customer support. We think it’s important to have post sales customer support as our customers will become our biggest marketers and making sure there happy with the product will help us in the future as farming is a close-knit community.

                                Nathan has a broad knowledge of IT systems as well as being a people person as evidenced by his work in consulting. Therefore, AGIT has chosen He as our marketing manager as we feel that he is the best person to sell our product due to the combination of IT knowledge and his understanding of human behaviour. We think it’s important to have a marketing manager because without customers we do not have a business, and it is Important we make back the capital back spent on research and development.

                                Due to only having 5 weeks to work on this project, AGIT have had to set a limit on what we are going to be able to produce in that time as we will not have time to develop the app and hardware needed for the final product. We have decided that we are going to wire frame both concepts of the project (the app and the feeder hardware) along with an in-depth report on the idea and technology used. We feel this will give the best idea to the market of how the product is going to work along with the features and dimensions of hardware. We believe this is enough to show our concept in-depth without crossing the line of it being unattainable.

                                If one task fits in category 1, no UI improvement for that task is required. If another task could not be done (by a number of people) at all, it is likely that the user interface is not efficient for that area and needs to be improved.

                                will be tested by us in a test lab. For instance, the load bars of a scale will be put under load and the expected current, according to the specific load, will be compared to the actual current. The output of the scale to the input of the hardware interface and finally to the software will then also be compared to the expected value. The same principle is used for all other hardware components.

We will add imaginary cattle, determine their food demand according to the imaginary weights and calculations given by the software. We will then run the test in a fast-forward mode, measure feed, let the scale return data to the software and finally enter expected and unexpected weight gain results. This will happen repetitively until we no bugs or expected outcomes are present anymore.

                                  The second stage of this test will then involve 5-10 third-party farmers which can be chosen from one of our team member’s professional network. They will be given access to our software and some hardware parts (which, as an incentive, can be kept and will be updated after the beta phase), with some conditions: they need to perform certain measurements and tasks in a specific timeline. This data the needs to be returned to us and final changes can then be made.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  All of these tests require intensive preparation and elaboration of results and as consequently bug-fixing. The tests don’t have to happen in the order given above: as soon as the UI is done, it can be tested. As soon as the hardware is done, first tests can be executed. The user acceptance testing, however, will be the last test and will probably run for 8 weeks (this is necessary to monitor the actual gain of the cattle and then compare it to the expected data). 100% accuracy of the AI instance of the project should not be expected in that timeframe, as it needs to adjust to every single situation separately.

                                  As AGIT has decided to create an agricultural set of hardware and software tools to enable farmers to take advantage of cost savings through this particular technology, a number of risks can be looked at in detail.  One of the first challenges to get over is learning the programming language required to write such an app as there will need to be app specific software developed alongside hardware interfacing middleware which will be used in order for the hardware, such as weight and flow sensors to read the information and then translate this into code that the application software can understand and process.  The time taken to learn the different required languages may take longer than intended as the group is new to programming on this level and will have to learn from basically scratch which will push the timeframe out significantly if not managed correctly.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  As the project will be utilizing weight sensors and flow meters to gauge quantity and distributed load, the need to factor in changes in environmental weather conditions as well as the strength of the equipment used.  The change in weight between dry product and wet product can vary exponentially depending on if the machinery is in sunny conditions or varying wet weather conditions as light and heavy rain will add extra weight to the unit as a whole and will change the density of the feed being distributed.  A possible solution to this could be the use of rain and humidity sensors which again will have to be learned into the system and trained in varying conditions which could result in multiple data logging inconsistencies.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Once the project is at a point that it could be released for beta testing it will need to pass a series of app store requirements which can vary across different platforms.  Along with the different store requirements to get the app into the app stores coding may need to be re configured to run on different types of devices such as android, apple, phones, tablets, laptop etc.. This could also produce the risk of coding taking a long time to both learn and complete due to such a novice level of understanding in this area.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Moving away from any software challenges stated, building the physical hardware to support the system and produce reliable results will also bring with it many engineering challenges.  For weight sensors to work they will need to be positioned adequately to gather accurate information.  Flow meters will need to be put in place and tested for clogs or other failures along with being in a position so as the readings are accurate for what the machine is dispensing.

                                  In summary, there are going to be plenty or hurdles to overcome such as the ones listed above and many more that we may not even know about until the project reaches a stage that a problem may come up which will also have to be solved which is always a risk in any project undertaken.

                                  Group communication will primarily be conducted as voice conferences by using Microsoft Teams. Group meetings are scheduled on it and are made viewable on the calendar of each group member where they can choose to reject or accept it. These group meetings are expected to occur at least twice a week, in the middle of the week (Wednesdays) and at the end of the week (Saturdays). Depending on the schedule of each group member, these meeting times are flexible and can be adjusted accordingly to suit the preferred time for each member. They are held to discuss important details of the project at length and to check on the overall progress of the project. If any group member is unable to attend the meeting, it is recorded so that those members can listen to the recording and not be left out on any important details discussed or decisions made.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  The secondary means of communication of the group is conducted through text messages by using WhatsApp. It is a simple and quick method of notifying group members of small details and for each member to communicate to the group of sudden changes to meeting times or unavailability. It is also used for posting updates on the progress or completion of individual tasks. This application is free and available on each group member's mobile device, so it is incredibly convenient to access. Most informal communication is conducted here, and it is expected that group members who have been unable to attend meetings should still communicate through this platform.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  Another method of communication of the group is to post comments in the task plan on Microsoft Teams. This keeps a record of important information posted by each group member under the related task. Group members can easily work on their tasks using this information at their convenience because it is available to be read at the convenience of each person. It is the group’s forum where group members can discuss the related task work under its own topic according to their own timing. Every member is expected to post their opinions or suggestions on important tasks and check their name off the checklist included once they have done so or if they have nothing to contribute on the matter and are satisfied with it.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  In the case of lacking communication from a group member, the group is lenient about this and will not act on it if the group member manages to complete their work on time and sends messages to the group at least once in two weeks. Active communication is preferred but is not enforced on any group member. In the event of a group member still not communicating after a period of two weeks, the rest of the group will have to discuss and agree on the appropriate action to be taken. A warning would be given before any serious decisions are made regarding the status of the group member.
