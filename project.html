                    Overview
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Many traditional farmers around the world work in a way in which their parents and grandparents had
                    worked. With a rising demand of food and more often occurring extreme weather events (for instance
                    the
                    drought in Australia at the moment), the traditional way may not always be the optimal way. Primary
                    producers, however, often rely on their experience and because of that, the potential growths of
                    animals
                    or the amount of applied fertilizer or seed, for instance, may not be ideal. Furthermore,
                    agricultural
                    equipment, even most recent models, often rely on the farmer monitoring physically, the convenience
                    and
                    productivity can be increased by sensors and actuators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At AGIT we will use modern information technology to help farmers to improve production, efficiency
                    and
                    profits while reduce the strain on the environment. Our bigger picture is to develop and produce a
                    network of sensors, actuators and user interfaces, connected to a cloud-based software (“the
                    brain”), to
                    address all of the issues given above. Having said that, our focus for this project will lie on a
                    feed
                    demand calculator for cattle, accessible via web browsers, smartphones and user interface displays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Australia is one of the largest beef exporters in the world (GLOBAL SNAPSHOT l BEEF, 2019) and large
                    parts of Australia are in a drought. Not all livestock can be saved. To revive an operation after a
                    catastrophic weather event like the current drought, a core of the stock needs to be saved and fed
                    through the event. Our feed calculator will help with that.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    The project: The Feed Calculator
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to develop an intelligent platform which uses state of the art technology, meticulous
                    research and experience to provide beef farmers with a tool which allows to calculate feed
                    quantities
                    for a set target weight gain. In the following paragraphs we will discuss some background-knowledge,
                    technologies and skills which are required to realize this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The growths of animals, specifically cattle, highly depends on several factors. Age, nutritional
                    intake
                    (that includes the nutritional values of different feeds), growths stage, health- and weather
                    condition,
                    accessibility of natural feed resources, gender, breed and pregnancy are only some of them. A young
                    animal, which is likely to be in a growth phase, gains weight easier than an older animal which has
                    nearly grown out, given the ideal nutrition. A pregnant or even lactating animal is in higher
                    energy,
                    more specific protein, demand than a dry cow. Animals in cold weather need more hay (not grain –
                    grain
                    would be contra-productive and lead to a waste of resources) to produce warmth while animals in
                    summer
                    can eat more grain as the body temperature will rather be regulated down then up. However, hay is
                    not
                    hay, grain is not grain. To make sure to hit a target, feed need to be tested for different
                    nutritional
                    values. Muscle gain – important for younger animals and older bulls – can only be achieved with a
                    certain level of overall protein intake (it should, during the growth stage, be above 15% but under
                    19%
                    - everything above 19% will use energy to digest the protein with the result of no weight gain). A
                    baseline for the feed calculations will be formed by experience (our team member Angelo has
                    collected
                    and experimented with data in regard to cattle feeding on a cattle stud farm) and intensive research
                    and
                    integration of data by other institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we have seen, the nutritional demand for cattle is dependent on many different factors. So how
                    would
                    we be able to provide a farmer with a general formula to feed their cattle? For now, we will not be
                    able
                    to achieve that. Having said that, we are aiming to use AI with collects data from all clients to
                    suggest the best starting point for everyone. This means that with a growing database of clients,
                    the
                    suggestions, which will consider similar circumstances of farmer A & B, will improve in giving the
                    best
                    result straight away. In every other case, the AI will concentrate on one client: if the gained
                    weight
                    is higher or lower than the target weight, it will adjust the quantities of feed automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence, which can be prototyped with devices like Google’s Coral or NVIDIA’s
                    Jetson, is
                    only one aspect of the project. Having said that, this is actually only going to happen in the
                    background. What about the user interaction, though? How can we let the farmer interact with our
                    software? Technologies required to provide a good platform for user input and software output are
                    programming (front- and backend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python & database
                    technologies
                    as well as Swift and Java for mobile applications) and hardware integration (user interfaces could
                    be
                    realized with Raspberry PIs; processing of sensor and actuator information could be done by
                    Arduinos).
                    With these tools and our development, the farmer will not only be able to access the software via
                    browser or smartphone but a satellite unit, which could be in the shed, could provide the most
                    recent
                    feed plan and tell how much product needs to be fed to which mob.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hardware & technology won’t make the project happen on its own. Skills required, but not limited to
                    it,

                <p>
                    Information technology with its hard- and software tools and a broad knowledge of how to use them,
                    as
                    well as a deep insight and thorough research on animal feeding can help primary producers to firstly
                    keep a core of their animals, even in difficult situations, alive and in fair condition to get back
                    on
                    track after the situation has changed and secondly, can help farmers in normal circumstances to
                    improve
                    the production and of livestock and efficiency therefore improve profit and reduce the strain on the
                    environment. AGIT’s goal is to provide a tool to the farmers to realize all of these points.
