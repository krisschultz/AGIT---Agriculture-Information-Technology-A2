                            We interviewed David Taylor, an IT Manager who works for Visium Networks, a safety &
                            security company. The interview was conducted online in Microsoft Teams by two of our team
                            members on the 2nd of October 2019.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What exactly do you do?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            David Taylor: This is a very good question. I guess I’m an IT manager at a security company,
                            dealing in security alarms and camera systems. What I largely do is manage a whole lot of
                            office server infrastructure and maintain a network with our business and equipment on it,
                            wherever the equipment is.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Please tell us about the industry that you work in.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: The security industry tends to be quite backwards regarding technology, though where we
                            are, we are running network security systems which is starting to be common process. As
                            recent as a few years ago they were still using dial up technology. These days there is a
                            lot more IP networking.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What other kinds of work do you do?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Apart from what we have discussed, there is a lot of troubleshooting in my role. I don’t
                            have strict discipline job roles, so often I’ll be doing troubleshooting here and there and
                            things that you wouldn’t typically associate with an IT manager, even looking into things
                            such as why a customer can’t log into a website remotely. Customer systems have their own
                            database and users, and while we try to simplify that it can often get quite convoluted, for
                            example off-site backups and copies around the place in-case of disaster.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about
                            them.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Well, at the top there is the directors of the company that I answer to, largely that’s
                            about trying to get money for new stuff and the pet projects of theirs. Particularly if
                            you’re in charge and you have a technology project idea, usually you tend to run with it.
                            Some of these ideas are not practical all the time. This includes if there’s a new
                            technology that they want to integrate into the systems. For example, there are a lot of
                            fads at the moment around image processing, hardware that can identify different things in
                            images. However, integrating it and making it work is a different thing. Then of course
                            there is our service manager who does all the actual physical work to make the systems work
                            across site and making sure everything connects up. Who else is there? I suppose the sales
                            team as well, but mostly just for desktop support stuff – when their email doesn’t work. We
                            also run a call centre and if anything breaks in there, it’s usually server infrastructure
                            so software might have crashed, that sort of thing. Managing their software is ongoing. That
                            is probably the same everyone, isn’t it? We have a software developer as well who is largely
                            autonomous but we work together to get different servers and whatever else these projects
                            need to get up and running, ‘spec'ing’ things out, software developers typically don’t have
                            much of an idea when it comes to the physical hardware side of things and the requirements
                            for software that they’ve made.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: Largely, I have limited interactions. But mostly around the networking side of things,
                            so for example if there is a fault with a particular customers network, often our customers
                            are quite large corporates, so they’ll have their own IT departments, getting a fault logged
                            with them and going through their servers to get it processed, escalating problems past
                            their level one and two or to wherever it needs to be to get resolved. The reality is though
                            that once you’ve done that more than once or twice you tend to remember the names and
                            numbers of the people that you need to. It can become informal after that but that usually
                            how it works.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What about your interactions with clients or investors?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: I don’t actually have a lot of direct interactions with clients in that sense.
                            Occasionally there might be something particularly bad that has happened to one of our
                            customer end users, something might not be working as they would have expected, or something
                            weird happened. But it would have to be unusual enough to end up on my plate. That’s pretty
                            rare actually, more just being helpful to customer support, IT departments are pretty
                            forgiving.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about those.
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: There’s the maintenance and routine type stuff. I spend all of Monday going through
                            checking things to make sure everything is right. I do this based off experience, make sure
                            there’s no beeping or lights flashing, log into everything and check them all and you’d be
                            surprised by how many problems you pick up by doing that sort of thing and from there make
                            sure all the back-ups are done. That’s a Monday then Tuesday my routine might be picking up
                            on the latest security technology updates or software that we are using which can take hours
                            to actually digest and, in the meantime, you have other bits and pieces to do. But yeah, I
                            would say it’s the routine things that take up most of my time, believe it or not. Whether
                            it is backing up a generator or what not or just making sure stuff runs smoothly. Making
                            sure nothing breaks, because in a bad situation I don’t have luxury of going home and
                            dealing with it tomorrow, I have to sit there and make sure that it is fixed. I’ve had
                            situations where that has taken 8 hours – I don’t want that to happen. And since I’ve
                            started doing this, I don’t get very many problems or things breaking in the middle of the
                            night, I haven’t had one for months.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Which aspects of your work do you find the most challenging?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: I think the most challenging part is keeping everything up to date. It cost money to buy
                            new software and equipment and it can be really hard sell to your boss. If I want $10K for
                            new software but there is no real tangible benefit other than they are up to date and won’t
                            be obsolete, and its important with cyber security, things are not getting patched and will
                            eventually break and stop working. That a very big problem, trying to make people who don’t
                            understand they actually need this.
                        </p>
                        <h6>
                            AGIT: Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of
                            the IT industry?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            DT: It’s such a weird question! The essence of the IT industry as far as interacting with
                            other companies is largely around support and issue finding and troubleshooting stuff – for
                            me anyway. When you ring through to somebody from another company and you get referred, and
                            you are sitting there on the phone, working through a tough problem, that what I would call
                            the IT industry working at its best. Because you sitting their diagnosing things, fixing
                            things together, even though you don’t know who they are and this kind of rhythm to it, that
                            is universal and it just works – I'd say it’s probably that!

                            defined by
                            the use of
                            storing or accessing data and services through a network most commonly, the internet. Some
                            of the
                            most common cloud
                            services are known as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and
                            infrastructure
                            as a service
                            (IaaS).

                            SaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted software such as Microsoft office

                            PaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted hardware and software solutions such
                            as
                            Microsoft azure. (Azure.microsoft.com, 2019)
                            IaaS is a subscription based model which offers hosted infrastructure such as Rackspace.

                            Each of these different services are similar in the ways they work and are all accessed via
                            the same
                            means through an internet connection from whatever device you are using or wherever you are
                            as long
                            as you have an internet connection. As the internet gets progressively faster more and more
                            users
                            are switching to cloud based services as the accessibility and availability is better than
                            ever
                            before.

                            Some of the benefits to switching to cloud based services for a large company may mean
                            instead of
                            hosting rooms full of expensive server equipment running everything from software to storage
                            on
                            site, they can lease the hardware from a provider at a monthly cost varied on the companies
                            needs.
                            As the company grows and the requirements grow they can simply ask for more servers or
                            storage space
                            for example and the impact is minimal along with the cost. If the company had to expand
                            onsite
                            storage for example this could cost tens of thousands of dollars in new hardware as opposed
                            to
                            simply adding onto an existing subscription cost.

                            Cloud technology and what makes it state of the art to say is that it is forming a
                            foundation for
                            the next generation of innovation and opens up the pathway for future exciting developments.

                            The future of cloud technology will build around speed and availability and we can look
                            forward to
                            seeing a huge increase in instant response time. This will allow new services such as

                            Cloud based services are made possible through the power of networking and the internet,
                            without
                            either of these there would be no cloud hosted services. Data centres also play a key role
                            in the
                            cloud as there needs to be a place to physically host all of these services and hardware
                            that is
                            being removed for the normal business environment.

                        <p>
                            The impact of the cloud is a huge deal which will and has changed the way that people,
                            business and
                            enterprise structure and scale. As cloud grows in popularity so do the services and

                            the technology which has opened up a whole new stream and use for the internet. This
                            technology is
                            allowing a whole new sector for training and to become a specialist in the field.

                            With a rapidly growing technology such as cloud we are starting to see more data centres
                            being built
                            and expanded all over the world as traditional data centre traffic is being overrun by cloud
                            services. According to networking giant Cisco, by 2021 cloud data centre traffic will
                            represent 95%
                            of total data centre traffic. (Provider, (GCI) and Papers, 2019)

                            The vast majority of individuals and business from small to enterprise that use a form of
                            computer
                            technology will in turn be affected in some way or another by cloud technology. This could
                            be from
                            so many different areas where cloud is used such as communicating to collaborating. For

                            having the need to provide as much IT infrastructure on site. Workstations can run as
                            effective thin
                            clients lowering the cost of hardware. On an individual level storage services are commonly
                            used for
                            even the most basic things such as storing photos or notes from your phone.

                            As companies can work and rely on the availability and uptime of cloud services this lessens
                            the
                            need for onsite IT staff meaning that a medium sized company who may have had teams of staff

                            other side
                            of the coin, cloud technology is also increasing the need for a skilled and specialised
                            workforce
                            which is in turn creating many new jobs across a number of areas from data centres through
                            to
                            developers, engineers and the list goes on.

                            Through my day to day life the cloud plays an integral part of both my work life and my
                            personal
                            life. All of my personal data from my mobile phone is backed up to a cloud service which
                            makes it
                            easy to change phones in case of damage or an upgrade as the backup can just be downloaded
                            to the
                            new device and from anywhere with an internet connection. The use of other cloud based
                            software
                            platforms such as Microsoft office 365 that I use for all kinds of work and communication
                            daily. In
                            my workplace we host our own cloud based services around the physical security industry
                            which has
                            turned a traditional set of analogue systems into a an IP and digital platform increasing

                            I have the ability to share data with colleagues and the freedom to work away from the
                            office in any
                            remote location and be able to service the business as If I were on site in the office
                            thanks to the
                            use of cloud hosted collaboration software. Even the simple things such as our phone system
                            that
                            traditionally used to be ran from an old degraded copper network known as our telephone

                            been upgraded to cloud hosted telecommunications technology using voice over IP or VoiP for
                            short.
                            This service offers a higher call quality along with less downtime.

                            Members of my family and friends also embrace the use of these above mentioned services as
                            it makes
                            their lives easier. Many cloud services offer family options where for a slightly higher
                            plan cost
                            the whole family can make use of the particular service. For example, I can purchase a
                            subscription
                            plan to Microsoft office 365 and for a few dollars extra use the software on more than just
                            the one
                            device. In many cases when purchasing an app for the smartphone it can be downloaded to up
                            to five
                            other family members through family sharing.

                            What does it do?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Small computing devices, also known as SBCs (Single Board Computers), like Raspberry PIs,
                            Arduinos
                            and Makey Makeys have become more popular than ever before. But what are those devices and
                            what can
                            they actually do?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The initial idea of these little computers was to provide affordable hardware with enough
                            power to
                            students and non-students to learn programming and engineering in a practical way. This idea
                            completely took off, and nowadays they are used everywhere: by students, hobbyists, or
                            companies to
                            develop and prototype projects of all kinds. They can also be used by pupils to get in
                            contact with
                            programming for the first time and to learn about science. Universities use them for
                            instance to
                            monitor and control robots or race cars. Another common usage is IoT (Internet of Things).
                            This is a
                            network of sensors and actuators in combination with SBCs which are locally separated but
                            communicate over the internet (or a local area network). For example, if an optical sensor
                            in a
                            warehouse senses too much light, window shades, up high on the roof, could be closed
                            automatically.
                            If now, however, the temperature drops to a critical point, another device could switch on a
                            heater.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SBCs are often not bigger than a credit card. The Raspberry PI foundation, for instance, has
                            just released the 4th version of its SBC which allows a user to connect two 4k displays,
                            USB3 devices and Gigabit Ethernet – all of that on a circuit board which measures only
                            85x56mm (Raspberrypi.org, 2019). However, one of the main features of all of these devices
                            is the “General-purpose input/output” (GPIO). The GPIOs are required to read and send data
                            to sensors like temperature-, motion-, magnetic- and light sensors, and actuators like
                            servo-, stepper- or DC motors, relays or solenoids. The variety of sensors and actuators are
                            endless and in combination with these little computers, the applications are unlimited. In
                            the end, the computer code written by the developer decides what the SBC does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A just recently released SBC is Google’s “Coral”. Coral’s focus lies in a different area,
                            though. It comes with a tensor processing unit (TPS) that helps to accelerate AI processing
                            locally (Coral.withgoogle.com, 2019). Similarly, NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano, also released in
                            2019, is equipped with a 128 core GPU – this is also a great advantage for AI processing
                            (NVIDIA Developer, 2019). The benefits of the local processing units are clear: the data is
                            saved locally; it is independent from the internet and delays caused by the internet
                            connections are reduced. Concerns about privacy are also limited as the data isn’t being
                            processed in some random datacentres.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the first appearance of single board computers, their power has increased
                            substantially and the use cases of them are not limited to data input / output and scrips
                            which process that data, anymore. For instance, the “UDOO x86 Ultra” or the “LattePanda
                            4G/64GB” are powerful enough to run mainstream operating systems like Windows 10
                            (Lattepanda.com, 2019) and can run most applications an average user would use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are likely to be two technological developments for SBCs in the near future which
                            don’t
                            necessarily require new but refined technology. The first development would be an even
                            higher
                            performance, more RAM and higher CPU & GPU speed. The other one would be the further
                            development of
                            AI technology for these devices. With that development, the application area will be even
                            broader
                            and yet in some cases (Coral or Jetson) more specific and specialized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To conclude, SBCs are (often) low-cost single board computers which have been originally
                            developed
                            for educational purposes. They are very small and yet powerful and can be used as a day-to
                            day
                            computer orin combination with sensors and actors to realize many different hardware
                            projects or to
                            provide an edge-computing solution for CPU-core demanding applications like AI on an
                            energy-efficient base. They are likely to increase in CPU, GPU and RAM and will be even more
                            suitable for the tasks given above.
                        </p>
                        <h5>
                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            These devices are quite unlimited in their options and use cases already. But how are
                            they going
                            to impact our future, what could potentially change and how could be most affected?

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            AI specific SBCs like the Coral or Jetson show that there could be a potential shift from
                            cloud
                            computing to edge computing. Companies and individuals could use these devices to process
                            their AI
                            locally instead of using big companies and their datacenters for that.
                            The complete opposite, however, comes in connection with cloud computing. As some SBC
                            hardware is
                            available already to run day to day tasks, clouds could be used to outsource more
                            CPU-demanding
                            tasks. A trend could develop to move away from powerful desktop- or laptop computers and
                            replace
                            them with cheaper SBCs. One result of that would be that people save money and resources and
                            people
                            which weren’t able to afford computers before, can possibly afford one now. Another
                            advantage of
                            using SBCs instead of bigger unites would be the potential reduction of energy consumption
                            as well
                            as the reduced demand for natural resources to produce the often “overpowered” home
                            computers.
                            Furthermore, the number of developers grow bigger and bigger. This can result in a flood of
                            very
                            innovative, new products developed in cooperation with professionals and non-professionals.
                            The open
                            source project “MagicMirror” (<a
                                href="https://magicmirror.builders/">https://magicmirror.builders/</a>) is a good
                            example for
                            that.
                            However, not only open source projects will benefit from SBCs. The number of tech startups
                            will also
                            increase as the financial capital needed is much smaller than without the accessibility of
                            those
                            tiny little helpers. This is likely to result in more competition and therefore higher
                            quality
                            products and probably also in a broader spectrum of innovations.

                            If they are going to be market a bit differently (more towards day-to-day user than towards
                            the avid
                            programmer or engineer), I think they can have a big impact on my friends and family. Many
                            of them
                            don’t require a lot of power and they could easily use these devices which then saves them
                            money. A
                            more subtle effect will be the appearance of smart devices which may have been develop on a
                            base of
                            SBCs and which possibly would not have been developed or only at a later point without the
                            accessibility of them.

                            I have personally only used the Raspberry PI so far, but they sparked such an interest in IT
                            in me,
                            that I have decided to dive deeper into the field and to study it. In the future, they will
                            likely
                            be used for three things by me.
                            First and for now most importantly, they will provide me a hardware base to support my
                            studies at
                            low cost. They will be my first choice to explore and learn IT hands-on. Arduinos or
                            Raspberry PIs
                            for more general programming experiences and to gain IoT knowledge, hardware like Coral or
                            Jetson as
                            a platform for potential AI studies.

                        <p>
                            Cyber security is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic
                            systems, networks and data from criminal attacks. It is also known as information technology
                            security (Kaspersky 2019) and it is broken into five different subsections, as the umbrella
                            term cyber security is very broad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first type of cyber security is that of protecting critical infrastructure security.
                            This refers to the security of physical systems that society rely on. For example, important
                            physical infrastructure are the electricity grid, traffic lights and hospital technology and
                            the cyber security here includes having contingency plans when the technology fails, so
                            society can carry on their daily lives uninterrupted (Mind Core 2019).

                            The second category is what is known as application security. This describes security
                            measures at the application level that aim to prevent data or code within an app being
                            stolen or hijacked. Application security can involve both software and hardware. For
                            instance, a router can be used to prevent anyone from seeing a computer’s IP address over
                            the internet. Additionally, software that creates a protective ‘firewall’ can be used to
                            strictly define what activities are allowed and prohibited to protect a specific application
                            (CM Ware 2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The third category is network security. Network security is the act of preventing and
                            protecting against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks (Fruhlinger 2018). This
                            can be as simple as setting up passwords for people who are authorized to access the systems
                            and networks, to having specialist intrusion detection and prevention software to identify
                            and block attacks using a data base of know techniques used by hackers (Comodo 2019).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Category number four of cyber security is cloud security. Cloud security is a set of
                            controls, policies, technologies and procedures used to protect cloud-based data (Chabrow
                            2011). This includes measures such as cloud storage providers having all storage backed up
                            on a secondary server, as well as encryption systems that use algorithms that are basically
                            impossible to break, to protect the data on their servers (Idexcel Technologies 2018).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The last and fifth category under cyber security is Internet of Things (IoT) security. This
                            category refers to safeguarding users’ personal information, which is stored on anything
                            that connects to the internet, for example your mobile phone, computer and smart watch. All
                            users of the internet need to protect themselves with this type of cybersecurity (Rouse
                            2019). The best way for consumers to do this is by educating themselves on ways that hackers
                            can get their personal information off their devices. That information could be for instance
                            banking or private information. It is advisable to protect yourself by using an internet
                            security software that can protect all of your devices that connect to the internet, such as
                            Norton security packages (Marr 2016). As the Information Technology (IT) world is growing,
                            so is the cyber security world as it tries to make the IT world a safer space for everyone
                            to use. One example to achieve that is a new software type called “user-behavior analytics”.
                            If someone is able to find out your password and get onto your network, the software will
                            pick up that the person isn’t following your usual behaviors on the device, i.e. they may
                            have a slower typing speed. The software will pick up these changes in behavior and lock the
                            person out of the computer. Then they will have to
                            answer a line of personal question that only the person who owns the account will be able to
                            answer correctly (Mello 2018), in this way protecting the device. New technology in cyber
                            security is improving due to improved hardware and coding software, allowing people in the
                            IT sector to turn ideas into usable tools for people and business to use to safeguard
                            themselves.

                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Cybercrime is costing the Australian economy 1 billion dollars a year. Australia is the 5th
                            highest targeted country in the world for cybercrime; 516,380 Australian small businesses
                            fell victim to cybercrime in 2017 (Catibog 2019). These statistics confirm why the cyber
                            security industry is so important. It highlights why new technology in this space will help
                            give everyday people peace of mind while using the internet to conduct transactions as well
                            as small and large business to conduct their business practices. Improving cyber security
                            technology will also help save the economy money, as the government will be able to spend
                            less on protecting government information using cyber security. Furthermore, government
                            agencies such as police investigating criminal matters conducted using information
                            technology will be increasingly improved. As the world becomes more reliant on IT, for
                            example the rise of robotics and automated assembly lines to produce, transport and sell
                            goods, cyber security jobs will become in demand and more will be created. As companies that
                            have technology-based assets run on technology, these will need to employ someone to make
                            sure they are secure as possible. An example of this is the use of automated forklifts in
                            warehousing, there is no longer a need for drivers. However, it is important that someone is
                            making sure the security system is tight to access the controls. Otherwise an unauthorized
                            person could login to the system and cause also sorts of chaos costing a company a lot of
                            money to rectify. More cyber security jobs will also be created in the government sector in
                            coming years with welfare payments and government payments increasingly being conducted
                            online. Making sure these transactions are being transacted securely will become more
                            important as time goes on as physical brick and mortar, face to face service center’s
                            disappear.

                        <p>
                            Cyber security is important to me as I use devices every day that are connected to the
                            internet to complete personal transactions like internet banking. It is also important for
                            me to understand the risks of cybersecurity as studying and paying some of my bills online,
                            I fill out a lot of forms with my personal details on them. However, due to increasing and
                            cheaper household software like anti-virus and a password protected home networks I feel
                            safer using the internet to conduct these personal transactions. However, older people in my
                            family – like my grandparents – need help and to be better educated on the risks of cyber
                            security. They need to understand what they can do to protect themselves, as they have been
                            caught out with unscrupulous people accessing their banking to take advantage of them.
                            Luckily, a local Hi-Fi chain contacted them, because the transactions looked unusual. They
                            have been more careful since when using internet banking. These kinds of mistakes would be
                            so easy to make if you were not aware of cyber criminals and the tactics they use. It is
                            worth paying for anti-virus software in the home.

                            What does it do?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables a computer to
                            learn autonomously without the need for it to be explicitly programmed (SAS Institute 2019).
                            This is accomplished by the analysis of a set of data, known as training data, to create a
                            model that allows the computer to generate predictions or inferences from the data provided
                            (Google Cloud Platform 2017). These predictions or inferences can then be used to solve
                            various problems or answer difficult questions. For example, the manufacturing industry uses
                            machine learning to analyze the specific sounds made by aircraft engines (Columbus 2019).
                            Then, the computers are able infer if a machine passes quality tests or if it is failing by
                            using the training model generated from the analysis. This greatly benefits companies by
                            preventing breakdowns, thus saving them money (ibid.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Google recently showcased an updated version of their state-of-the-art voice assistant,
                            Google Assistant, coming to mobile phones in late 2019, that would greatly improve the user
                            experience by making its functionality available offline (Lee T. B 2019). Voice assistants
                            use machine learning in tandem with natural language processing technology to better
                            understand human speech (Barba P 2019). This requires a tremendous amount of computational
                            power as programmers work hard to improve speech recognition and make it more accurate (Lee
                            T. B 2019). Therefore, most companies such as Google and Apple use cloud services to offload
                            the computational demand from mobile phones to their own servers. This impairs the usability
                            of these useful assistants as they require an internet connection to connect to the cloud
                            and it takes time to transmit the necessary data. However, Google has managed to develop its
                            voice assistant to function offline so that it does not require an internet connection and
                            it is able to respond more quickly than before (ibid.).

                            Currently, this technology is applied in various fields such as entertainment,
                            accessibility, marketing, medical science, among others. For example, the entertainment
                            company Netflix uses machine learning in its recommendation algorithms to enhance its users
                            experience by recommending similarly appealing shows according to each users tastes (Netflix
                            2019). Furthermore, the company applies this technology to its efforts in acquiring new
                            shows, improving its video streaming technology, and creating content for its users (ibid.).
                            In the case of personalizing user recommendations, it is able to do this by analyzing how
                            its users make use of their service and identifying the characteristics of the shows that
                            are prominently viewed among its users and applying this into, for example, the visual style
                            in which shows are presented to a user through a thumbnail to present them in a more
                            appealing manner depending on the users taste.

                            In the near future, it is highly likely that machine learning will rapidly grow in its
                            applicability and further advance in its current state of technology. Many software
                            applications will begin to incorporate machine learning into its basic functionality
                            (Matthew Johnsen 2018). Moreover, this technology will increase in demand and rise in
                            popularity as a service for organizations that may want to utilize this technology but do
                            not want to heavily invest in the hardware and specialized handling necessary to run it.
                            Machine learning may even progress as far as to enable computers with the ability to
                            understand human language easily. IBM Watson Assistant is one example that may achieve this
                            as this technology continues to develop (ibid.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Machine learning is made possible today because of the numerous explorations and
                            experimentations by various companies and individuals to discover if a computer has the
                            ability of self-learning. The first self-learning computer program written by Arthur Samuel
                            was able to improve its capability of playing checkers by analysing and applying strategies
                            to win the game as it kept playing (Marr 2016). In the 1990s, machine learning started to
                            steer towards a data-driven approach of learning things where large amounts of data are
                            analysed by computers. As machine learning continued to develop, various more technical
                            achievements arose such as human gesture recognition in 2010 by Microsoft, categorisation of
                            objects in 2011 by Google Brain's deep neural network, and photo recognition software
                            capable of identifying individuals in 2014 by Facebook (ibid.).

                        <h5>
                            What is the likely impact?
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Machine learning has the potential to impact various areas of importance in the world today
                            such as climate change modelling, autonomous vehicles, medical research, and risk
                            assessments of machines (Protiviti Inc. 2017). It is likely that this impact will vastly
                            improve climate change models in terms of speed and accuracy. Thus, preventative measures
                            can be taken as more accurate predictions on areas affecting climate change are brought into
                            knowledge. Medical research is also being impacted by this through the improved analysis of
                            patient data and diagnoses and treatment suggestion (ibid.). This new age of data brought
                            about by machine learning has made more information available to the public and to companies
                            thus making them more aware and able to take measures in response to the patterns and
                            inferences discovered. Both the general public and the companies will be equally affected by
                            the impacts that machine learning carries with it. For example, any benefits that a hospital
                            would reap from improved medical research will also impact its patients by improving their
                            medication. However, the public are at risk to certain negative impacts that companies will
                            not be subjected to. One of these risks include the negligence of the best interest of
                            humans due to the possible distortion of data from faulty inputs and machines training on
                            this data including bias or errors for an extended period of time (ibid.). To mitigate this
                            risk, machine learning algorithms still need to be kept in check by data scientists.
                            Therefore, more jobs are created because of this field, whereby humans are still needed in
                            managing it as it cannot be fully autonomous at this time. Another example of this is the
                            technology of self-driving cars. It is a challenge to fully assess the ethical laws and
                            responsibility behind self-driving cars and whether or not it is a practical concept when
                            massively produced and used. Hence, public transport vehicles and its drivers are still much
                            needed in the world today.

                            In our daily lives, machine learning has an invisible effect on most people despite it
                            bringing major changes to our lives, more than the public is aware of. Although many
                            companies are well-versed in this technology, the majority of the public are still unaware
                            of how machine learning plays a role in their personal lives such as the products that are
                            manufactured, entertainment that is produced, new medical treatments, and especially online
                            shopping. Advertisements in particular are no longer random and are getting more
                            personalized. This is one area that may be less invisible to individuals as it is becoming
                            more apparent that it is not a coincidence that online advertisements are in alignment with
                            the websites that a user views or searches on a daily basis. This may leave most consumers
                            feeling uncomfortable or delighted at the fact that they can view advertisements that are
                            relevant to their interests. Although there are benefits to this, friends and family should
                            be educated and made aware of the technology powering the advertisements they see so
                            frequently. Viewing these advertisements so often may even lead to encouragement to spend
                            money or cause impulsive shopping in people. In contrast, friends and family may be able to
                            find solutions to the problems that they are facing either through a product or service. For
                            example, an individual secretly harboring depressive and suicidal thoughts may start to see
                            advertisements promoting suicide prevention hotlines or other forms of help. This would make
                            an enormous positive impact in the lives of our friends and family because it may bring the
                            individual's attention to these preventative measures. Additionally, friends and family’s
                            lives could be saved or made easier because of the advancement of medical research in light
                            of machine learning. The improved diagnoses and treatments may be able to further relieve
                            illnesses or conditions ailing a person.
